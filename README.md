### pragma solidity ^0.5.0;
`0.5.0` version of Solc was recently released. This version includes a lot of improvements over the previous release, but it has [breaking changes](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/latest/050-breaking-changes.html).

Current Truffle version does not support it, but its `beta` relase does. So, make sure you are up to date.

`npm install -g truffle@beta`
